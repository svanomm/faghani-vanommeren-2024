Recent literature has investigated the effects of more realistic data scenarios on the estimation of treatment effects via difference-in-differences (DiD). In particular, researchers now know that when treatment is staggered over time and the true treatment effect is dynamic and/or heterogeneous, then regressions of the form
$$y_{it} = \alpha_i + \lambda_t + \boldsymbol{\gamma}  D_{it} + \beta X_{it} + \epsilon_{it},$$
result in a (potentially largely) biased estimate. This bias can be so large that it results in an estimate of the opposite sign of the true effect.
We summarize the literature that led to this conclusion, and we discuss how these new results affect antitrust practitioners.
We perform a Monte Carlo analysis to investigate some of the properties of staggered DiD models, where we find some interesting results about unbalanced panels providing an additional source of bias for estimation.
